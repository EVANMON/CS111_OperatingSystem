Project 4a
Serial Number(S/N): BBGW17100362
MAC: 2CF7F1066D01

In this project, I connected my BeagleBone to my laptop with USB terminal and Wifi port separately. For Wifi connection, I connected both the BeagleBone and laptop to the hotspot of my mobile phone in order to transfer files from my Mac to the board.

Then by the Wifi port, I built and ran the helloworld.c file on the BeagleBone board with my terminal commands. Then, I installed the git and clone a remote test repository in my Github to the local on the board.
