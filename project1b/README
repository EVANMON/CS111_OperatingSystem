Project 1b
Files included:
1. lab1b-client.c: the source file for client 
2. Lab1b-server.c: the source file for server
3. Makefile: used to build program, clean files and generate tarball
4. README: brief introduction of the files and functions

The function can be run in the shell by:
$ gcc -lz -o lab1b-client lab1b-client.c
$ gcc -lz -o lab1b-server lab1b-server.c

Then you need to run the two programs at the same time:
First open the server: 
$ ./lab1b-server [--port=PortNum] [--compress]
Then open the client and input your commands in the client surface:
$ ./lab1b-client [--port=PortNum] [--log=LogFile.txt] [--compress]
$ <Your commands, ex. ls...>

Also, you can use Makefile to compile, check and generate tarball. The corresponding codes are:
 
>> make default : compile the resource files

>> make clean : remove all the files generated by check

>> make dist : build the distribution tarball
